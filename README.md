# ankirb

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ankirb.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ankirb)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rkachowski/anki-rb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rkachowski/anki-rb)
 
A basic gem to create [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) decks (.apkg). Supports integrated media (audio, images and videos).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ankirb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ankirb

## Usage

```ruby
require 'ankirb'

#create a deck
deck = Anki::Deck.new 'FancyExampleDeck'

#create a basic card
card = Anki::Card.new(:front=>"What is the french for cheese omelette?", :back=>"Omelette au fromage")

#add audio to the back
card.back << "dexters_lab_omelette.wav"

#add card to the deck
deck.add_card card

#export to ~/Anki/Decks/FancyExampleDeck.apkg
Anki::apkg.export deck, "~/Anki/Decks"

#import decks from an Anki apkg file
Anki::apkg_importer.import "~/Anki/Decks/FancyExampleDeck.apkg" do |decks|
  #the decks are unzipped in a temporary directory that lives
  #for the duration of this block
end
```

### Media types

Media can be added to a card face via the `<<` operator, just pass a string that points to a valid media file and the lib will convert + package the file. 

For images, the position of the image in the card can be set by using a placeholder `{{img}}`. 

```ruby
card = Anki::Card.new :front => "{{img}} text after image", :back => "text before image {{img}}"
card.front << "front_img.jpg"
card.back << "back_img.jpg"
```

If no placeholder is present the image will just be added at the end. If multiple placeholders are present, they'll be replaced sequentially with the image files added to the card.

As with anki, html tags can be used for more styling in the card content. Card model / css template support may be added in future.
